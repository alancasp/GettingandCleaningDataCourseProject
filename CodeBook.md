# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset was transformed into a tidy data table by grouping the original data set by subject and then by activities measured and summarized by the mean of each measurement for mean and standard deviation for each activity performed by each subject.  The variable labels were changed and inserted into the data table for easier understandability.

## Code Book
'xyz' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
